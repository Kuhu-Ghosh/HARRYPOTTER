                HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS
            </h1>
            <p class="abc">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the final book in the series, following Harry, Ron,
                and Hermione as they set out to destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. They leave Hogwarts and go into
                hiding, facing danger and betrayal while uncovering vital clues left by Dumbledore.

                Along the way, they learn about the Deathly Hallows—three legendary magical objects that make a wizard
                the Master of Death. Voldemort seeks the Elder Wand, the most powerful of the Hallows, to ensure his
                victory. Harry realizes that his own life is tied to Voldemort's through a piece of soul inside him.

                After a series of battles and losses, including the deaths of key characters like Dobby, Fred, and
                Lupin, the final confrontation takes place at Hogwarts. Harry willingly sacrifices himself, but survives
                and ultimately defeats Voldemort by destroying all the Horcruxes.

                The story ends with peace returning to the wizarding world. In the epilogue, set 19 years later, Harry
                and his friends are grown up, married, and sending their own children off to Hogwarts, bringing the saga
                to a close.
