                HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE
            </h1>
            <p class="abc">Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince follows Harry in his sixth year at Hogwarts. Lord Voldemort’s return is now public knowledge, and the wizarding world is in fear. Dumbledore takes a more active role in preparing Harry for the final battle by showing him memories that reveal Voldemort’s past and the secrets behind his immortality, particularly the Horcruxes—dark magical objects containing fragments of his soul.

Harry finds an old Potions textbook filled with notes by the mysterious "Half-Blood Prince," which helps him excel in class. Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy is given a secret mission by Voldemort, and Harry becomes suspicious of his activities. Romantic tensions grow—Harry falls for Ginny Weasley, while Ron and Hermione struggle with their own feelings.

The story takes a dark turn when Dumbledore is killed by Severus Snape during a mission to retrieve a Horcrux. Snape reveals himself to be the Half-Blood Prince. The book ends with Hogwarts shaken and Harry determined to find and destroy the remaining Horcruxes to defeat Voldemort.
