                HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX
            </h1>
            <p class="abc">Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth book in the series by J.K. Rowling. In
                this story, Harry returns to Hogwarts after a difficult summer, only to find that most people refuse to
                believe that Lord Voldemort has returned.

                The Ministry of Magic appoints Dolores Umbridge as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, and
                her strict control over the school leads Harry and his friends to form a secret group called
                Dumbledore’s Army to learn real defensive magic. Harry also struggles with disturbing visions linked to
                Voldemort’s mind.

                Eventually, he has a vision of Sirius Black being tortured, which leads him and his friends to the
                Department of Mysteries. There, they face Death Eaters and learn more about a prophecy that connects
                Harry and Voldemort. The battle ends with the tragic death of Sirius and the official confirmation that
                Voldemort has returned, setting the stage for the war to come.
