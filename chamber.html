                HARRY POTTER AND THE CHAMBER OF SECRECTS 
            </h1>
            <p class="abc">**Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets** is the second book in J.K. Rowling’s magical
                series. In this installment, Harry returns to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for his second
                year, despite warnings from a house-elf named Dobby. Soon, mysterious attacks begin to petrify students,
                and messages about a hidden "Chamber of Secrets" appear on the walls. As fear spreads, Harry, Ron, and
                Hermione investigate the legend of the Chamber, ultimately discovering that it was opened by Tom Riddle
                (Voldemort's younger self) through a magical diary. With bravery and help from Fawkes the phoenix, Harry
                defeats the monster inside — a deadly Basilisk — and saves Ginny Weasley.
