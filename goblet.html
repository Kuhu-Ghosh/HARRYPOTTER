                HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE
            </h1>
            <p class="abc"> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in J.K. Rowling’s series. In this
                story, Harry is unexpectedly entered into the dangerous Triwizard Tournament, a magical competition
                between three wizarding schools. Despite being underage and not submitting his own name, Harry is forced
                to compete.

                As he faces three challenging tasks, he uncovers a plot involving Barty Crouch Jr., who impersonates a
                teacher using Polyjuice Potion and manipulates the tournament. The final task leads Harry to a trap
                where Lord Voldemort regains his full body and powers. Harry narrowly escapes with the help of Cedric
                Diggory’s body and a magical portkey.

                The book marks a darker turn in the series as Voldemort returns to power, and the wizarding world begins
                to face the threat of his rise once again.
